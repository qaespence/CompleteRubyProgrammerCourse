## Course description

This is the most comprehensive course for learning how to program using the Ruby programming language. Why did we choose Ruby to teach programming? Not only is Ruby one of the easiest programming languages to get started with but it is also extremely powerful and provides tools for learning and using all the fundamentals of programming that can be used in any language - with its own flair for programmer happiness. Whether you are a complete beginner or already know the basics but want to know and apply advanced concepts in programming like OOP, automation using web scraping, data engineering and algorithms built from scratch - this is the course for you!

Ruby is also the programming language behind Ruby on Rails which is one of the most popular and in demand web development frameworks, with the highest paying jobs in the world today.

This course will teach Ruby, and programming in general, in a practical manner - you will be presented with concepts in screencast videos which you can code along with; followed by quizzes to test your understanding and programming assignments which will bring it all together to seal your knowledge. We go over the practical details of programming, issues that programmers face daily and build up your understanding in an efficient way. And with unlimited access - you can learn at your own pace!

By the end of this course, you will be able to write complete programs that can take input from users, build interactive menus, interact with formatted data files, automate life tasks like car shopping online using web scraping and engineering complex data from web server logs to your own specifications, among many other skills!
